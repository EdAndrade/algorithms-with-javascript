when we are talking about performance we use absolute measure

ex: if achieve 150m in 12s i am faster than who achives that in 15s

its pretty difficult predict the running time of an algorithm because there are a lot of dependents such as:

Programming language, the computer itself, the SO, the programs that are running beside and so on.
